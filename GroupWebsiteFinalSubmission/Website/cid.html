The Customer Identification Number (CID or CIN) is a three or four digit number that is unique to each credit card. This additional security feature is designed to protect the consumer by helping to ensure the credit card is present during the purchase. It is printed only on the card, never on any receipts or statements. The number is verified by the card issuer during the purchase.
<p>For Visa and MasterCard, the CIN is the last 3 digits after the credit card number in the signature area of the card. For American Express cards, the CIN is a 4-digit number printed above the imprinted card number on the front of the card (on either the left or right).</p>
