MusicFire
=========

An online music store that was created as a group project for a web-programming class.

The purpose of this project was to create a website for an e-merchant that would incorporate HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and a transactional database written in MySQL.

My group created MusicFire, a website that would allow users to create an account, log in, listen to 30-second samples of songs, and if they choose to, buy individual songs that would then be added to their library.
